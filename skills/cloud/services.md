## Best For

**iCloud**
- Apple ecosystem users (iPhone + Mac)
- People who want zero setup — just works
- Family Sharing with other Apple users

**Google Drive**
- Gmail users (storage is shared)
- Android phone owners
- Google Docs/Sheets power users
- Those who need more free storage (15 GB)

**Dropbox**
- Cross-platform users (Windows + Mac + Android + iOS)
- People who need reliable sync (historically the best)
- Teams that need simple file sharing

**OneDrive**
- Windows users
- Microsoft 365 subscribers (you already have 1 TB)
- People who work with Word/Excel daily

## Switching Services

**Download everything first:**
- iCloud: icloud.com → Select all → Download
- Google Drive: takeout.google.com → Drive
- Dropbox: dropbox.com → Download folder
- OneDrive: onedrive.com → Download folder

**Then upload to new service.** Don't try to sync between services — download locally first.

## Hidden Gotchas

- **Google:** 15 GB includes Gmail and Photos. Heavy email users fill up fast.
- **iCloud:** macOS/iOS backups count against quota. Check Settings → iCloud → Manage.
- **Dropbox:** Free tier has device limits (3 devices).
- **OneDrive:** Personal vs work accounts can get confusing. Check which you're signed into.
