# Geomanic — OpenClaw Skill

Connect [OpenClaw](https://www.getopenclaw.ai) to [Geomanic](https://geomanic.com), your privacy-first GPS tracking companion.

## What you can do

- **Query travel statistics** — distances, speeds, altitudes, country breakdown
- **Manage waypoints** — create, update, delete, list, and search GPS waypoints
- **Analyze journeys** — ask natural language questions about your travel data

## Setup

### 1. Get your API key

Go to [geomanic.com/data](https://geomanic.com/data) and generate an MCP API key in the "MCP Integration" tile.

### 2. Install the skill

```

```

### 3. Configure

Set your API key:

```
/secrets set GEOMANIC_TOKEN gmnc_mcp_your_key_here
```

Or configure in `openclaw.json`:

```json

  "skills": {
    "@monswyk/geomanic": {
      "enabled": true,
      "config": {
        "apiKey": "${GEOMANIC_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
