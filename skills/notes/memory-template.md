# [DECISION] Pricing Model for v2 — 2026-02-19

## Context
Current flat pricing doesn't capture value from high-usage customers. Need to decide on v2 pricing before March launch.

## Options Considered

### Option A: Usage-Based
- ✅ Aligns cost with value
- ✅ Lower barrier to entry
- ❌ Unpredictable revenue
- ❌ Complex to communicate

### Option B: Tiered Plans
- ✅ Predictable revenue
- ✅ Easy to understand
- ❌ May leave money on table
- ❌ Upgrade friction

### Option C: Hybrid (Base + Usage)
- ✅ Predictable base + upside
- ✅ Fair for all segments
- ❌ More complex billing
- ❌ Harder to forecast

## Decision
**Chosen:** Option C — Hybrid model

## Rationale
Combines predictability of tiers with fairness of usage. Competitors moving this direction. Customer interviews showed preference for "pay for what you use" with a floor.

## Implementation
- **Owner:** @finance
- **Effective Date:** 2026-03-01
- **Review Date:** 2026-06-01

## Dependencies
- Requires: billing system upgrade [[2026-02-10_billing-update]]
- Blocks: launch communications

## Reversal
- [REVERSES] [[2025-06-15_flat-pricing]] — Original flat pricing decision
