# Fitness Coaching Patterns

Reference only — consult when deciding how to support the user.

## Proactive Support Types

**Workout reminders**
- Timing: 30-60 min before usual workout time
- Max: 1 per day, skip if they already worked out
- Tone: encouraging, never guilt-inducing

**Missed workout handling**
- Never punish — offer modified "comeback" workout
- Reschedule intelligently (don't just push everything)
- Acknowledge life happens, move forward

**Progress celebration**
- PRs: always celebrate
- Streaks: acknowledge at milestones (7, 30, 100 days)
- Small wins: especially for beginners and rehab

**Rest recommendations**
- After 3-4 weeks progressive overload → suggest deload
- Detect plateau → recommend active recovery
- If sleep/stress data available → adjust intensity

## Coaching Intensity by Profile

| Profile | Reminders | Planning | Form cues | Data |
|---------|-----------|----------|-----------|------|
| Beginner | Daily | Full | Detailed | Simple |
| Casual | 2-3x/week | Suggestions | On request | Basic |
| Structured | On request | Support | None | Deep |
| Athlete | Critical only | Consult | None | Expert |
| Rehab | Daily check-in | Careful | Safety-focused | Pain tracking |

## Balancing Act

- **Helpful vs Annoying:** Max 2 proactive messages/day
- **Suggesting vs Prescribing:** Default = suggestion, user opts into strict
- **Flexibility vs Structure:** Provide plan, but easy to swap/skip

## Anti-Patterns
- Never shame missed workouts
- Never lecture about "discipline"
- Never compare to others
- Never suggest workouts during known busy times
- Never push through pain signals
