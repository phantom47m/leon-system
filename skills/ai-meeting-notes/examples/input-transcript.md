Duration: 45 minutes

[00:00] Sarah: Okay, let's get started. Quick product sync. Mike, John, Lisa should be joining in a minute.

[00:15] Mike: I'm here. Lisa said she'd be a few minutes late.

[00:22] Sarah: No problem. Let's start with the website redesign. I've been working on the mockups and I should have them ready to show everyone by Friday. I'll need feedback by Monday so we can stay on track.

[00:45] Mike: Friday works. But I'm a bit concerned about the overall timeline. Are we still targeting the February launch?

[01:02] Sarah: That's actually what I wanted to discuss. I think we need to push the launch by two weeks. There's just too much to do and I don't want to rush it.

[01:18] Mike: Makes sense. I'd rather delay than launch something half-baked.

[01:25] John: Agreed. Two weeks is fine.

[01:30] Sarah: Okay, so we're all aligned on pushing the launch. I'll update the project timeline.

[02:15] Sarah: Next up, Q1 marketing. John, you had the budget conversation?

[02:22] John: Yeah, good news. Budget got approved. We have 50k to work with.

[02:30] Mike: Nice! That's more than we asked for.

[02:35] John: I know, right? So I'm going to handle the social media campaigns. But I need assets from the design team. Lisa, when she gets here, can you coordinate with the agency on the paid stuff?

[02:50] Lisa: Hey everyone, sorry I'm late. What did I miss?

[02:55] Sarah: We pushed the website launch two weeks, budget got approved at 50k. John needs you to coordinate with the agency on paid campaigns.

[03:10] Lisa: Got it. I'll reach out to them today.

[05:30] Mike: One more thing - we have an unhappy enterprise customer. Acme Corp. They're frustrated with the last update.

[05:45] Sarah: What's the issue?

[05:48] Mike: Performance problems on their end. I'm going to call them tomorrow to smooth things over. Might need to offer some kind of discount or credit, but I'll check with leadership first.

[06:15] Sarah: Keep us posted on that.

[08:00] Sarah: Last thing - hiring. We still need a senior dev. I'll post the job listing by end of week.

[08:12] John: Oh, I actually know someone who might be good. Former colleague. I'll make an intro.

[08:20] Sarah: Perfect, thanks John.

[08:30] Sarah: Alright, I think that's everything. Next sync Thursday at 2pm. Oh, and John, you're out next week right?

[08:40] John: Yeah, vacation. Back on the 5th.

[08:45] Sarah: Enjoy. See everyone Thursday.
