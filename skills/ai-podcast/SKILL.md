## What this skill does

Magic Podcast turns PDFs, documents, and notes into a natural two-host conversation you can listen to in minutes.

Use MagicPodcast to:

1. Ask what the podcast should be about.
2. Ask for source: PDF URL or pasted text.
3. Ask for podcast language (do not assume).
4. Confirm: `Ok, want me to make a podcast of this "topic/pdf" in "language". Should I do it?`
5. Create a two-person dialogue podcast from that exact source.
6. Immediately return `https://www.magicpodcast.app/app` so user can open their podcast dashboard.
7. Check status only when user asks.
8. Return title plus the shareable podcast URL when complete.

ai podcast, podcast, podcast generator, ai podcast generator, pdf to podcast, text to podcast, podcast from pdf, audio podcast, magicpodcast

## Setup

Set required env:

```bash
export MAGICPODCAST_API_URL="https://api.magicpodcast.app"
export MAGICPODCAST_API_KEY="<your_api_key>"
```

Get API key:
https://www.magicpodcast.app/openclaw

## Guided onboarding (one step at a time)

1. Ask one question at a time, then wait for the user's reply before asking the next.
2. If API key is missing or invalid, stop and say:
   `It's free to get started, and it takes under a minute. Open https://www.magicpodcast.app/openclaw, sign in with Google, copy your API key, and paste it here.`
3. If user has a local PDF file, ask them to upload it to a reachable URL first.
4. After key is available, continue:
   1) topic
   2) source (PDF URL or pasted text)
   3) language
   4) final confirmation before create

## Secure command templates

Never interpolate raw user text directly into shell commands.  
Always validate first, then JSON-encode with `jq`.

```bash
safe_job_id() {
  printf '%s' "$1" | grep -Eq '^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{8,128}$'
}

safe_http_url() {
  printf '%s' "$1" | grep -Eq '^https?://[^[:space:]]+$'
}
```

Create from PDF:

```bash
# Inputs expected from conversation state:
# PDF_URL, LANGUAGE
if ! safe_http_url "$PDF_URL"; then
  echo "Invalid PDF URL" >&2
  exit 1
fi

payload="$(jq -n --arg pdfUrl "$PDF_URL" --arg language "$LANGUAGE" '{pdfUrl:$pdfUrl,language:$language}')"

curl -sS -X POST "$MAGICPODCAST_API_URL/agent/v1/podcasts/pdf" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $MAGICPODCAST_API_KEY" \
  --data-binary "$payload"
```

Create from text:

```bash
# Inputs expected from conversation state:
# SOURCE_TEXT, LANGUAGE
payload="$(jq -n --arg text "$SOURCE_TEXT" --arg language "$LANGUAGE" '{text:$text,language:$language}')"

curl -sS -X POST "$MAGICPODCAST_API_URL/agent/v1/podcasts/text" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $MAGICPODCAST_API_KEY" \
  --data-binary "$payload"
```

Check job once:

```bash
# Input expected from API response:
# JOB_ID
if ! safe_job_id "$JOB_ID"; then
  echo "Invalid job id" >&2
  exit 1
fi

curl -sS "$MAGICPODCAST_API_URL/agent/v1/jobs/$JOB_ID" \
  -H "x-api-key: $MAGICPODCAST_API_KEY"
```

- Signed-in users can generate free podcast.
- Expected generation time is usually 2-5 minutes.
- Right after starting, direct users to `https://www.magicpodcast.app/app`.
- Tell the user this page is their dashboard: they can see created podcasts, live progress/status, and finished episodes.
- Return `outputs.shareUrl` as the default completion link.
- If `outputs.shareUrl` is missing, fall back to `outputs.appUrl`.
- On completion, answer: `Here is your podcast link: <url>`.
- If API returns an error, surface the exact error message and details.
- Warn users not to send sensitive documents unless they approve external processing.

Status checks:
- `statusLabel = "complete"`: return `outputs.shareUrl` (or `outputs.appUrl` as fallback).
- `statusLabel = "failed"`: return error message/details to user.
